00:00.000 --> 00:04.533
(gentle piano music)

2
00:04.523 --> 00:06.713
Welcome! You’re in the right place

3
00:06.693 --> 00:08.423
if you’re a manager looking to learn about

4
00:08.410 --> 00:11.433
how to make responsible use of public funds.

5
00:11.429 --> 00:13.262
There are many reasons why managers

6
00:13.248 --> 00:16.132
like you might take this course.

7
00:16.129 --> 00:17.972
You might be a new manager who’s new

8
00:17.969 --> 00:20.270
at financial delegation.

9
00:20.264 --> 00:22.044
You could be an experienced manager

10
00:22.018 --> 00:23.292
but new to government

11
00:23.278 --> 00:25.579
and looking to leverage your experience.

12
00:25.578 --> 00:27.543
Maybe you just came back from a parental leave

13
00:27.527 --> 00:29.513
and you could really use a refresher.

14
00:29.499 --> 00:31.543
Or perhaps you’re an experienced manager in

15
00:31.539 --> 00:34.945
government and you need to recertify every 5 years

16
00:34.940 --> 00:37.445
in order to continue exercising

17
00:37.430 --> 00:39.730
your financial delegation.

18
00:39.720 --> 00:42.205
Maybe you just really want to get to the test!

19
00:42.190 --> 00:43.815
Whatever brought you here,

20
00:43.810 --> 00:45.988
you’re in charge of your own learning.

21
00:45.980 --> 00:48.268
Think of this as a “choose your own adventure”

22
00:48.270 --> 00:50.592
kind of experience and take what you need

23
00:50.572 --> 00:53.118
in order to succeed. If all you need

24
00:53.118 --> 00:54.432
is to take the test because

25
00:54.432 --> 00:56.442
you’re already pretty familiar with the content,

26
00:56.420 --> 00:59.204
then, by all means, start with that.

27
00:59.200 --> 01:01.984
If you just need an overview or a refresher,

28
01:01.980 --> 01:04.554
then simply review the key messages

29
01:04.550 --> 01:08.741
of each phase to get to the key highlights and tools.

30
01:08.720 --> 01:10.101
You'll also want to make use

31
01:10.080 --> 01:12.380
of the handy features on your screen,

32
01:12.350 --> 01:14.401
like the toolbox on the top right,

33
01:14.390 --> 01:15.871
which has tools and resources

34
01:15.870 --> 01:18.754
to help you on the job.

35
01:18.740 --> 01:20.244
If you’re learning this for the first time,

36
01:20.240 --> 01:23.394
then take the time to go through each section,

37
01:23.380 --> 01:25.354
do the in-depth learning activities,

38
01:25.350 --> 01:27.064
 and review the tools and resources.

39
01:27.060 --> 01:30.116
We promise it’s worth the effort!

40
01:30.096 --> 01:33.114
You’re probably wondering about the test.

41
01:33.090 --> 01:36.084
Passing the test for this course is mandatory

42
01:36.060 --> 01:39.234
before you can exercise financial delegation.

43
01:39.230 --> 01:43.244
The passing grade is 80% for each of the sections.

44
01:43.234 --> 01:45.014
Each section should take you

45
01:45.010 --> 01:47.714
around 15 to 20 minutes to complete.

46
01:47.690 --> 01:50.468
You can access course materials during the test

47
01:50.458 --> 01:53.918
and you can take it as many times as you need.

48
01:53.908 --> 01:56.058
In the end, how you use this course

49
01:56.038 --> 01:57.734
is really up to you!

50
01:57.730 --> 01:59.764
It will remain accessible to you so

51
01:59.750 --> 02:02.050
you can come back to consult different sections

52
02:02.030 --> 02:05.584
and tools, whatever you need on the job!

53
02:05.570 --> 02:07.174
We’re rooting for you!

54
02:07.150 --> 02:09.450
Because when you steward public funds well,

55
02:09.430 --> 02:11.730
you succeed in your career.

56
02:11.710 --> 02:14.704
And, more importantly, you serve Canadians well,

57
02:14.690 --> 02:16.990
 with transparency and accountability.

58
02:16.960 --> 02:19.260
And that’s the bottom line.

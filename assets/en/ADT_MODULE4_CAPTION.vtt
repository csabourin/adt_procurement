2
00:10.977 --> 00:12.144
- [Instructor] In this section,

3
00:12.144 --> 00:14.114
you will learn to define your goods,

4
00:14.114 --> 00:17.506
services and construction needs,

5
00:17.484 --> 00:20.518
consider any special requirements,

6
00:20.518 --> 00:22.489
and describe what you need.

7
00:22.489 --> 00:24.791
This section should take you approximately

8
00:24.791 --> 00:27.504
45 minutes to complete.

9
00:32.231 --> 00:37.803
(gentle music)

10
00:37.804 --> 00:39.871
To begin the procurement process,

11
00:39.871 --> 00:41.941
you need to figure out what you need;

12
00:41.941 --> 00:43.908
or, in procurement terms,

13
00:43.908 --> 00:46.911
you need to figure out your requirements.

14
00:46.911 --> 00:49.198
No one else can do this for you.

15
00:49.182 --> 00:51.451
Your team knows your business.

16
00:51.451 --> 00:54.758
They know what is needed to support it.

17
00:54.753 --> 00:56.856
Here's a list of questions that will help you

18
00:56.856 --> 00:59.057
define your requirements.

19
00:59.057 --> 01:03.045
What is required and why is it required?

20
01:03.029 --> 01:05.298
Can the work be broken down into tasks,

21
01:05.298 --> 01:07.905
activities, or phases?

22
01:07.900 --> 01:11.304
When is each piece or phase required?

23
01:11.304 --> 01:13.938
Can one phase begin before the approval

24
01:13.938 --> 01:15.432
or completion of another?&lt;br&gt;

25
01:15.423 --> 01:20.022
Will the final delivery be in a modern treaty

26
01:20.013 --> 01:23.954
or a comprehensive land claims agreement area?

27
01:23.950 --> 01:26.218
Are there other indigenous considerations

28
01:26.218 --> 01:28.594
related to procurement?

29
01:28.587 --> 01:30.188
Where will the work be done?

30
01:30.188 --> 01:33.093
What skills are required to do the work?

31
01:33.093 --> 01:37.129
Are you sure about the quantity that is required?

32
01:37.128 --> 01:40.246
Will this be a recurring requirement?

33
01:40.233 --> 01:43.503
What are the security requirements?

34
01:43.503 --> 01:45.037
Who will keep ownership

35
01:45.037 --> 01:49.257
of any intellectual property generated?

36
01:49.242 --> 01:52.212
Has accessibility been considered?

37
01:52.212 --> 01:56.703
Has green procurement been included?

38
01:56.683 --> 01:58.918
Be clear about what you need.

39
01:58.918 --> 02:01.888
If you have difficulty defining your requirements,

40
02:01.888 --> 02:04.224
why not contact your procurement specialists

41
02:04.224 --> 02:07.560
for a bit of help or to obtain templates.

42
02:07.560 --> 02:09.861
Or visit the For Government section

43
02:09.861 --> 02:14.334
of the buyandsell.gc.ca website,

44
02:14.334 --> 02:17.134
a great source of information.

45
02:17.137 --> 02:19.770
After all, if you request a motor vehicle,

46
02:19.770 --> 02:21.973
you don't wanna end up with a smart car

47
02:21.973 --> 02:24.943
when what you really need is a pickup truck!

48
02:29.615 --> 02:36.029
(gentle music)

49
02:36.020 --> 02:38.091
When defining your procurement needs,

50
02:38.091 --> 02:39.843
think about special requirements

51
02:39.842 --> 02:41.832
and other considerations.

52
02:41.832 --> 02:45.056
For example, instead of buying standard chairs,

53
02:45.039 --> 02:47.303
could you pay a bit more for chairs that are

54
02:47.288 --> 02:49.433
ergonomic and more durable?

55
02:49.419 --> 02:50.912
In the long run more people

56
02:50.912 --> 02:52.181
will be able to use them

57
02:52.180 --> 02:53.231
and they won't need to

58
02:53.211 --> 02:54.912
be replaced as often.

59
02:54.912 --> 02:55.991
That's good news for your

60
02:55.979 --> 02:58.714
budget and for the environment.

61
02:58.711 --> 03:02.094
Here are a few questions to get you started.

62
03:02.080 --> 03:05.788
What are the accessibility or ergonomic needs?

63
03:05.752 --> 03:07.218
Have you considered getting advice

64
03:07.218 --> 03:09.923
from people with disabilities?

65
03:09.923 --> 03:11.491
Is it public facing, meaning

66
03:11.490 --> 03:14.348
will the public have access to it?

67
03:14.360 --> 03:16.895
Are there GBA+ considerations?

68
03:16.895 --> 03:20.309
Has it been prepared in both official languages?

69
03:20.300 --> 03:22.300
Are there applicable trade agreements?

70
03:22.300 --> 03:24.669
Does it involve a former public servant?

71
03:24.669 --> 03:28.039
Is there an intellectual property component?

72
03:28.039 --> 03:29.974
Do modern treaties or comprehensive

73
03:29.974 --> 03:32.412
land claims agreements apply?

74
03:32.412 --> 03:34.712
Does the department have exceptional delegations

75
03:34.712 --> 03:37.584
like the Department of National Defense?

76
03:37.584 --> 03:39.953
Does it consider green procurement?

77
03:39.953 --> 03:42.309
What level of security is involved?

78
03:42.298 --> 03:45.359
For example, is it secret?

79
03:45.358 --> 03:47.239
Are there a specialized shipping

80
03:47.228 --> 03:49.219
or packaging requirements?

81
03:49.193 --> 03:51.562
Is it of interest to the media?

82
03:51.562 --> 03:55.501
Will it carry over multiple fiscal years?

83
03:55.501 --> 03:57.630
If you are not sure that you've considered

84
03:57.604 --> 03:59.405
all the special requirements,

85
03:59.405 --> 04:02.008
contact your procurement specialist,

86
04:02.008 --> 04:04.278
they will have most likely seen

87
04:04.268 --> 04:06.187
purchases like yours before

88
04:06.179 --> 04:08.514
and can help you with your requirements.

89
04:12.550 --> 04:19.185
(gentle music)

90
04:19.192 --> 04:20.560
You have figured out what you need

91
04:20.560 --> 04:22.394
and identified your requirements.

92
04:22.394 --> 04:23.730
That's great!

93
04:23.730 --> 04:25.238
Let's move on to how you must

94
04:25.238 --> 04:26.868
document your decisions.

95
04:26.865 --> 04:29.235
First, you need to draft a description.

96
04:29.235 --> 04:30.903
There are five ways you can do this.

97
04:30.903 --> 04:33.957
Let's look at them one by one.

98
04:33.939 --> 04:36.742
A design specification is a detailed description

99
04:36.742 --> 04:38.810
of the item to be purchased.

100
04:38.810 --> 04:42.115
It could include drawings and required dimensions,

101
04:42.115 --> 04:46.023
size and dimension, materials, physical properties,

102
04:46.019 --> 04:50.037
quality test results, environmental, ergonomic,

103
04:50.023 --> 04:52.458
and aesthetic considerations,

104
04:52.458 --> 04:55.228
accessibility considerations for people with visible

105
04:55.228 --> 04:57.730
or invisible disabilities,

106
04:57.730 --> 05:00.747
anticipated repair and maintenance needs,

107
05:00.733 --> 05:02.935
level of quality to be achieved,

108
05:02.935 --> 05:07.627
safety standards to be met, etc.

109
05:07.617 --> 05:10.255
Performance specifications set the operational

110
05:10.245 --> 05:12.911
requirements of an item or an installation.

111
05:12.911 --> 05:14.379
In other words, they describe

112
05:14.379 --> 05:18.151
what the final installed product must be able to do.

113
05:18.151 --> 05:21.487
They outline the required output, functions

114
05:21.487 --> 05:25.109
or operations of the item and the equipment.

115
05:25.824 --> 05:28.528
Combination design and performance specifications

116
05:28.528 --> 05:31.497
incorporate the attributes of both the performance

117
05:31.497 --> 05:37.199
specifications and the design specifications.

118
05:37.170 --> 05:40.439
Purchase description specifications provide a brief

119
05:40.439 --> 05:44.209
but accurate description of the desired production.

120
05:44.209 --> 05:47.012
They list the product by national, international

121
05:47.012 --> 05:48.680
or industrial reference standards,

122
05:48.680 --> 05:51.350
such as a 10 mm wrench,

123
05:51.350 --> 05:53.653
a screwdriver or a two-by-four.

124
05:56.541 --> 05:58.095
Indigenous economic measures

125
05:58.095 --> 06:00.195
enhance economic opportunities

126
06:00.185 --> 06:01.555
for Indigenous Peoples

127
06:01.551 --> 06:03.715
and businesses through increased opportunity

128
06:03.717 --> 06:07.365
to compete for contracts via the Procurement

129
06:07.359 --> 06:09.460
Strategy for Aboriginal Business,

130
06:09.437 --> 06:11.889
the Treasury Board Directive on Government

131
06:11.879 --> 06:13.899
Contracts, including Real Property Leases

132
06:13.882 --> 06:17.370
in the Nunavut Settlement Area and through

133
06:17.361 --> 06:20.379
departmental indigenous economic measures.

134
06:21.747 --> 06:24.016
Then once you've prepared the description,

135
06:24.016 --> 06:26.685
you must present it in either a statement of work

136
06:26.685 --> 06:28.821
or a statement of requirement.

137
06:28.821 --> 06:31.891
Here's a bit more information on each option.

138
06:31.891 --> 06:34.917
A statement of work describes the work required

139
06:34.917 --> 06:37.797
in clear, concise, and meaningful terms.

140
06:37.797 --> 06:40.266
It includes the deliverables or the services

141
06:40.266 --> 06:45.138
or work needed to fulfill the contract.

142
06:45.137 --> 06:46.618
A statement of requirement is

143
06:46.608 --> 06:48.198
a description of the need

144
06:48.198 --> 06:51.377
without specifying the exact method to be used.

145
06:51.377 --> 06:53.846
It includes problem definition information

146
06:53.846 --> 06:55.882
which will provide context

147
06:55.882 --> 06:57.649
for the approving authority,

148
06:57.649 --> 07:00.353
as well as an initial assessment of risk

149
07:00.353 --> 07:02.788
and basic financial information regarding

150
07:02.788 --> 07:07.411
what will be produced in the next stage.

151
07:07.391 --> 07:09.693
Since you will be the one preparing either

152
07:09.670 --> 07:11.192
the statement of work

153
07:11.172 --> 07:12.803
 or the statement of requirement,

154
07:12.798 --> 07:14.100
have a look at the job aids provided

155
07:14.100 --> 07:16.668
provided in the Toolbox for guidance.

156
07:20.105 --> 07:26.586
(gentle music)

157
07:26.579 --> 07:28.572
Did you know that when carrying out

158
07:28.558 --> 07:30.125
their procurement duties,

159
07:30.125 --> 07:33.872
managers must adhere to the laws, regulations

160
07:33.869 --> 07:36.754
and policies established by the government?

161
07:36.754 --> 07:39.062
This means carrying out the procurement process

162
07:39.056 --> 07:41.755
in a transparent, fair, and open manner

163
07:41.745 --> 07:44.505
for suppliers. And what happens

164
07:44.495 --> 07:46.895
if managers don't follow these rules?

165
07:46.899 --> 07:49.000
Well, there are different levels of authorities

166
07:49.000 --> 07:51.137
in place that check to make sure that

167
07:51.137 --> 07:53.581
the rules are being followed.

168
07:53.572 --> 07:55.641
It is also important that the relationship

169
07:55.641 --> 07:58.144
between your organization and a contractor

170
07:58.144 --> 08:00.680
remain on a strictly business level.

171
08:00.680 --> 08:03.249
Contractors must not be treated as employees

172
08:03.249 --> 08:07.185
as this would be contrary to or conflict with

173
08:07.185 --> 08:09.187
the Public Service Employment Act

174
08:09.187 --> 08:11.114
and common law principles dealing

175
08:11.088 --> 08:13.725
with employer-employee relationships.

176
08:13.725 --> 08:15.694
In addition, managers are responsible

177
08:15.694 --> 08:17.362
for preventing the development

178
08:17.362 --> 08:19.665
of an employer-employee relationship

179
08:19.665 --> 08:22.600
for the duration of the contract.

180
08:22.600 --> 08:24.536
For more information on a transparent,

181
08:24.536 --> 08:26.805
open and fair procurement process,

182
08:26.805 --> 08:29.574
see the job aid on "What Not To Do"

183
08:29.574 --> 08:32.644
as well as the job aid on "Legal Framework".

184
08:36.249 --> 08:42.824
(gentle music)

185
08:42.788 --> 08:44.524
I have good news for you!

186
08:44.524 --> 08:46.457
As a manager you're not expected

187
08:46.457 --> 08:48.793
to be an expert in procurement.

188
08:48.793 --> 08:51.529
Your organization will have procurement specialists

189
08:51.529 --> 08:54.298
to provide guidance and support.

190
08:54.298 --> 08:57.403
You are however responsible for certain things.

191
08:57.403 --> 08:59.111
You must make sure that

192
08:59.089 --> 09:00.774
you have the required funding.

193
09:00.783 --> 09:02.851
You must provide the technical requirements

194
09:02.841 --> 09:05.043
and evaluation criteria.

195
09:05.043 --> 09:06.278
And once received,

196
09:06.278 --> 09:08.279
you must confirm that the goods and services

197
09:08.279 --> 09:11.606
are acceptable as per the contract.

198
09:11.582 --> 09:13.384
So when exactly do you need the help

199
09:13.384 --> 09:15.413
of a procurement specialist?

200
09:15.388 --> 09:18.224
Here's some of the general recommendations.

201
09:18.224 --> 09:20.125
When you do not have the proper transaction

202
09:20.125 --> 09:22.695
or contracting delegation.

203
09:22.695 --> 09:24.755
When your department does not have the delegation

204
09:24.730 --> 09:28.155
to purchase the goods or services itself.

205
09:28.167 --> 09:29.268
When the requirement falls

206
09:29.268 --> 09:31.802
to Public Services and Procurement Canada

207
09:31.802 --> 09:34.400
or Shared Services Canada.

208
09:34.373 --> 09:36.064
When the procurement requires

209
09:36.067 --> 09:37.324
 Treasury Board approval.

210
09:37.308 --> 09:39.043
Don't forget, even if you're not required

211
09:39.043 --> 09:41.514
to consult your procurement specialist for purchases

212
09:41.514 --> 09:43.849
within your delegated authority,

213
09:43.849 --> 09:45.283
they're always there to guide you,

214
09:45.283 --> 09:48.086
answer your questions and support you.

215
09:48.086 --> 09:50.355
After all why spend hours doing research

216
09:50.355 --> 09:52.423
and developing documents from scratch

217
09:52.423 --> 09:53.993
when your procurement specialist

218
09:53.993 --> 09:58.495
has templates waiting for you!

219
10:00.197 --> 10:05.949

220
10:05.937 --> 10:07.840
Depending on what you are procuring,

221
10:07.840 --> 10:10.789
you may need to consult stakeholders in security,

222
10:10.774 --> 10:13.144
information technology, communications,

223
10:13.144 --> 10:16.014
and translation, to name but a few.

224
10:16.014 --> 10:18.533
After all, you can't be an expert in every field

225
10:18.517 --> 10:21.153
and you don't know what you don't know!

226
10:21.153 --> 10:24.350
In fact, in certain cases you must consult

227
10:24.340 --> 10:26.892
stakeholders. For essential commodities

228
10:26.892 --> 10:29.760
such as advertising and public opinion research,

229
10:29.759 --> 10:32.336
you must use Public Services

230
10:32.333 --> 10:33.786
and Procurement Canada.

231
10:33.764 --> 10:35.033
For legal services,

232
10:35.033 --> 10:37.302
each department has their own assigned lawyers

233
10:37.302 --> 10:39.171
from the Department of Justice,

234
10:39.171 --> 10:42.575
and contracts for the performance of legal services

235
10:42.575 --> 10:47.385
may be entered into only by or under the authority

236
10:47.379 --> 10:50.356
of the Minister of Justice.

237
10:50.349 --> 10:52.966
People with a wide range of disabilities

238
10:52.951 --> 10:56.589
may also use the service or item being procured.

239
10:56.589 --> 10:58.355
Be sure to consult your department's

240
10:58.355 --> 11:00.926
network of employees with disabilities

241
11:00.926 --> 11:03.293
for advice on removing obstacles

242
11:03.293 --> 11:06.994
to accessibility for the end user.

243
11:10.067 --> 11:16.454
(gentle music)

244
11:16.442 --> 11:18.834
You have now defined your requirements and figured

245
11:18.814 --> 11:21.745
out who you need to consult, what's next?

246
11:21.745 --> 11:23.581
Well, that depends on the dollar amount

247
11:23.581 --> 11:26.283
and the complexity of what you need to buy.

248
11:26.283 --> 11:29.771
You either initiate the purchase of low-dollar-value

249
11:29.754 --> 11:31.791
procurements using instruments

250
11:31.791 --> 11:34.240
that you have at your disposal yourself;

251
11:34.225 --> 11:36.306
or, you work with your procurement specialists

252
11:36.306 --> 11:38.495
to determine the procurement strategy for more

253
11:38.486 --> 11:41.604
complex, higher-dollar-value procurements.

254
11:41.600 --> 11:43.491
Regardless of the procurement strategy

255
11:43.485 --> 11:45.431
that you choose, always consider

256
11:45.425 --> 11:46.861
how much time it will take you

257
11:46.853 --> 11:48.611
to complete the procurement process.

258
11:48.605 --> 11:52.874
For example, items on the buyandsell.gc.ca website

259
11:52.855 --> 11:55.696
must be posted for a minimum of 40 days,

260
11:55.695 --> 11:57.816
as applicable, if subject to

261
11:57.815 --> 11:59.206
our international trade agreements

262
11:59.183 --> 12:02.855
or for complex or big-ticket items such as fleets,

263
12:02.855 --> 12:05.091
the process can take over a year.

264
12:05.091 --> 12:08.187
So please plan accordingly!

265
12:08.192 --> 12:10.096
The following exercise will help you

266
12:10.096 --> 12:11.995
to review your knowledge of procurement

267
12:11.995 --> 12:14.264
strategies and instruments.

268
12:14.264 --> 12:16.033
The toolbox also contains a

269
12:16.033 --> 12:20.618
"Commonly Used Procurement Instruments" job aid.

270
12:22.875 --> 12:29.527
(gentle music)

271
12:29.514 --> 12:32.149
Take what you've learned into real life!

272
12:32.149 --> 12:33.730
Your organization will have

273
12:33.713 --> 12:35.250
its own ways of doing things.

274
12:35.244 --> 12:37.300
Take time out from the course to see which

275
12:37.310 --> 12:40.810
procurement strategies you will use most often.

276
12:40.793 --> 12:42.961
Find the templates your department uses

277
12:42.961 --> 12:44.820
and look up examples of

278
12:44.812 --> 12:46.800
previous purchases for guidance.

279
12:46.798 --> 12:49.422
This will be helpful when it comes time

280
12:49.422 --> 12:52.311
for you to choose a procurement strategy.

281
12:54.774 --> 13:01.386
(gentle music)

282
13:01.379 --> 13:04.115
Now that you've seen how to define your goods,

283
13:04.115 --> 13:06.152
services and construction needs,

284
13:06.152 --> 13:08.254
consider any special requirements,

285
13:08.254 --> 13:09.855
and describe what you need,

286
13:09.855 --> 13:11.196
let's see what you remember

287
13:11.196 --> 13:12.386
by taking this short quiz.

288
13:12.389 --> 13:14.960

00:00.208 --> 00:03.253
(gentle music)

2
00:09.300 --> 00:10.426
- [Instructor] In this section,

3
00:10.426 --> 00:14.013
you will learn to initiate the solicitation process,

4
00:14.013 --> 00:16.265
evaluate bids and negotiate,

5
00:16.265 --> 00:19.686
and approve and award competitive contracts.

6
00:19.686 --> 00:20.528
This section should take you

7
00:20.519 --> 00:23.189
approximately 30 minutes to complete.

8
00:29.028 --> 00:31.698
(gentle music)

9
00:34.075 --> 00:35.876
Now that you've drafted your requirements

10
00:35.868 --> 00:38.079
and prepared either your statement of work,

11
00:38.079 --> 00:39.956
or your statement of requirements

12
00:39.956 --> 00:43.746
and chosen your procurement strategy, what's next?

13
00:43.710 --> 00:45.628
The procurement specialists will develop

14
00:45.628 --> 00:47.756
the acquisition strategies needed

15
00:47.756 --> 00:50.591
to satisfy the requirements you provided.

16
00:50.591 --> 00:53.603
This may include preparing the bid solicitation

17
00:53.578 --> 00:58.098
documents, managing the bid evaluation process,

18
00:58.098 --> 01:01.101
evaluating the financial proposals,

19
01:01.101 --> 01:03.362
selecting the suppliers,

20
01:03.353 --> 01:05.613
negotiating the procurement agreements,

21
01:05.606 --> 01:09.820
and formalizing the procurement agreements,

22
01:09.819 --> 01:11.528
but before we jump to the activity,

23
01:11.528 --> 01:12.920
are you curious to see

24
01:12.915 --> 01:15.540
examples of solicitation documents?

25
01:15.533 --> 01:19.555
Why not visit the buyandsell.gc.ca website?

26
01:19.537 --> 01:20.851
You will find many examples

27
01:20.851 --> 01:24.167
from various organizations. And don't forget,

28
01:24.167 --> 01:25.709
you will have a role to play

29
01:25.709 --> 01:27.281
answering technical questions from

30
01:27.253 --> 01:30.924
potential suppliers during the solicitation process.

31
01:36.012 --> 01:38.680
(gentle music)

32
01:42.227 --> 01:43.785
The solicitation document

33
01:43.783 --> 01:45.815
has been prepared and distributed.

34
01:45.813 --> 01:46.814
That's great.

35
01:46.814 --> 01:49.233
Now it's time for more work.

36
01:49.233 --> 01:51.713
Once the bidding closes, the manager,

37
01:51.694 --> 01:54.614
along with their chosen bid evaluation team,

38
01:54.614 --> 01:56.740
evaluates the technical bids

39
01:56.740 --> 02:01.056
against the established technical evaluation criteria.

40
02:01.047 --> 02:03.966
Some examples of this could involve reviewing

41
02:03.956 --> 02:06.876
proposals to determine if bidders meet criteria,

42
02:06.876 --> 02:09.711
such as qualifications and years of experience

43
02:09.711 --> 02:11.131
in the field of work,

44
02:11.131 --> 02:12.715
or how the proposed bids meet

45
02:12.715 --> 02:14.675
the accessibility requirements

46
02:14.675 --> 02:17.804
and the design specifications.

47
02:17.804 --> 02:20.473
The procurement specialist then verifies

48
02:20.473 --> 02:22.432
that the bids are complete,

49
02:22.432 --> 02:24.769
sends the technical portion to the manager

50
02:24.769 --> 02:27.328
and the technical team for review,

51
02:27.312 --> 02:29.399
performs the financial evaluation

52
02:29.399 --> 02:31.918
once the technical evaluation is done,

53
02:31.901 --> 02:34.444
and conducts any negotiations necessary

54
02:34.444 --> 02:36.205
on the manager's behalf

55
02:36.197 --> 02:39.720
and applies the selection methodology.

56
02:39.720 --> 02:43.246
For processes that fall within modern treaties,

57
02:43.246 --> 02:45.414
such as Comprehensive Land Claims Agreement,

58
02:45.413 --> 02:48.107
or the Treasury Board Directive on government

59
02:48.107 --> 02:50.836
 contracts, including real property leases

60
02:50.836 --> 02:53.088
in the Nunavut Settlement Area,

61
02:53.087 --> 02:56.107
the evaluation of indigenous benefits criteria

62
02:56.091 --> 02:59.392
may be considered as part of the bids.

63
02:59.392 --> 03:00.889
Did you know that communicating

64
03:00.889 --> 03:03.557
with a supplier during a competitive process,

65
03:03.557 --> 03:05.475
other than through bidders' conferences

66
03:05.474 --> 03:08.132
and requests for information, could be seen

67
03:08.143 --> 03:12.706
as favoritism or creating an unfair advantage?

68
03:12.692 --> 03:14.818
So avoid communication with suppliers

69
03:14.818 --> 03:16.737
during a competitive process.

70
03:16.736 --> 03:20.060
Send them to your contract authority instead.

71
03:20.040 --> 03:22.890
The following activity will help you confirm your

72
03:22.890 --> 03:26.579
knowledge of the evaluation and negotiation phase.

73
03:26.580 --> 03:29.417
For more information on the bid evaluation team,

74
03:29.417 --> 03:31.752
see the job aid in the toolbox.

75
03:37.342 --> 03:40.010
(gentle music)

76
03:45.014 --> 03:47.131
Once a bidder has been selected based on their

77
03:47.131 --> 03:49.437
ability to satisfy the requirement,

78
03:49.437 --> 03:51.027
procurement specialist will seek

79
03:51.021 --> 03:53.608
to have the contract approved.

80
03:53.608 --> 03:55.651
This involves, when appropriate,

81
03:55.651 --> 03:57.981
having the contract reviewed by peers

82
03:57.961 --> 04:01.881
or legal services, a cost analysis review,

83
04:01.866 --> 04:05.377
a risk review if the requirements changed,

84
04:05.370 --> 04:07.121
a quality assurance review,

85
04:07.121 --> 04:09.831
and possibly an approval by a contract review

86
04:09.830 --> 04:13.595
and approval committee, or Treasury Board.

87
04:13.586 --> 04:15.963
Once this process is completed,

88
04:15.963 --> 04:17.673
the procurement specialist sends out

89
04:17.673 --> 04:19.968
the contract documents for signature

90
04:19.968 --> 04:22.560
by the delegated transaction authority,

91
04:22.552 --> 04:25.764
or contracting authority in your organization,

92
04:25.764 --> 04:27.975
and then the supplier.

93
04:27.975 --> 04:30.257
In many cases, the procurement officer

94
04:30.257 --> 04:32.646
is a delegated transaction authority

95
04:32.646 --> 04:36.107
or contracting authority who signs the contract.

96
04:36.107 --> 04:39.653
Are you wondering who will approve the contract?

97
04:39.653 --> 04:41.863
The following activity will help you identify

98
04:41.863 --> 04:44.492
the individuals with the signing authority.

99
04:51.456 --> 04:54.127
(gentle music)

100
04:57.672 --> 04:59.214
Following contract approval,

101
04:59.214 --> 05:02.384
the procurement specialist will award the contract.

102
05:02.384 --> 05:04.052
Depending on the contract's value,

103
05:04.052 --> 05:06.430
the specialist may send regret letters

104
05:06.430 --> 05:08.157
to unsuccessful bidders

105
05:08.149 --> 05:10.067
and post a contract award notice

106
05:10.059 --> 05:15.898
on PSPC's buyandsell.gc.ca/tenders site

107
05:15.898 --> 05:19.176
to inform the public of the successful bidder.

108
05:19.175 --> 05:21.346
Debriefings are provided

109
05:21.340 --> 05:23.776
to unsuccessful bidders on request,

110
05:23.781 --> 05:26.800
and should normally include an outline of the factors

111
05:26.783 --> 05:30.080
and criteria used in the evaluation.

112
05:30.079 --> 05:33.108
They are typically led by the procurement specialist

113
05:33.081 --> 05:34.640
while you play the supporting role

114
05:34.634 --> 05:37.908
of answering technical evaluation questions.

115
05:37.898 --> 05:40.438
The only information provided to the bidder

116
05:40.423 --> 05:42.841
is the evaluation of it's bid

117
05:42.841 --> 05:45.636
and the score it's bid received.

118
05:45.636 --> 05:48.437
Proposal information on any other bidder

119
05:48.430 --> 05:50.182
must not be divulged.

120
05:55.562 --> 05:58.232
(gentle music)

121
06:02.903 --> 06:05.378
Take what you've learned into real life.

122
06:05.365 --> 06:06.728
Your organization will have

123
06:06.711 --> 06:08.658
its own ways of doing things.

124
06:08.658 --> 06:10.244
Take some time out from the course

125
06:10.244 --> 06:12.663
to see how the solicitation process works

126
06:12.663 --> 06:14.877
in your department.

127
06:14.874 --> 06:17.837
Maybe your organization has an intranet page on

128
06:17.837 --> 06:19.947
procurement, or maybe your procurement specialists

129
06:19.920 --> 06:22.287
have the templates that you need.

130
06:22.278 --> 06:24.992
Looking at previously prepared solicitation

131
06:24.992 --> 06:27.220
documents can sometimes help.

132
06:27.220 --> 06:30.180
And don't forget to check the Toolbox for a job aid

133
06:30.180 --> 06:31.973
on the procurement process.

134
06:36.646 --> 06:39.314
(gentle music)

135
06:42.776 --> 06:46.040
Now that you've seen how to initiate the solicitation

136
06:46.030 --> 06:49.330
process, evaluate bids and negotiate,

137
06:49.324 --> 06:52.764
and approve and award competitive contracts, let's

138
06:52.740 --> 06:56.021
see what you remember by taking this short quiz.

00:12.217 --> 00:15.861
In this section you will learn to administer,

2
00:15.841 --> 00:19.601
pay and close out the contract.

3
00:19.591 --> 00:20.734
This section should take you

4
00:20.727 --> 00:24.484
approximately 30 minutes to complete.

5
00:35.664 --> 00:37.913
The contract has been awarded.

6
00:37.914 --> 00:40.100
You might think your work is done, right?

7
00:40.082 --> 00:43.343
Not so fast! There is still more to do!

8
00:43.342 --> 00:45.619
With the help of your procurement specialist,

9
00:45.615 --> 00:47.139
you must now administer the contract

10
00:47.123 --> 00:49.259
that you have just awarded.

11
00:49.250 --> 00:52.259
Let's take a minute to see who does what.

12
00:52.250 --> 00:55.750
As the manager, your responsibilities include

13
00:55.730 --> 00:58.486
monitoring the timelines, deliverables,

14
00:58.490 --> 01:00.606
costs, and quality of the work

15
01:00.589 --> 01:03.820
against an agreed-upon work plan and statement of

16
01:03.816 --> 01:06.831
work, ensuring delivery dates are met,

17
01:06.832 --> 01:10.915
ensuring contractors are not treated as employees,

18
01:10.915 --> 01:14.125
attending progress meetings as required,

19
01:14.125 --> 01:18.332
managing the contract's expenditures or burn rate,

20
01:18.331 --> 01:21.055
responding to Access to Information requests

21
01:21.045 --> 01:23.095
and ministerial enquiries,

22
01:23.081 --> 01:27.415
and issuing task authorizations, as required.

23
01:27.414 --> 01:29.545
As for the procurement specialist,

24
01:29.545 --> 01:31.415
their responsibilities include:

25
01:31.384 --> 01:33.028
supporting the manager in

26
01:33.018 --> 01:35.318
monitoring contract progress and financing,

27
01:35.318 --> 01:38.428
attending progress meetings, as required

28
01:38.415 --> 01:40.665
resolving any disputes,

29
01:40.665 --> 01:42.915
amending the contract as needed,

30
01:42.915 --> 01:45.207
performing contract audits,

31
01:45.207 --> 01:48.875
issuing task authorizations, as needed

32
01:48.875 --> 01:51.112
supporting the manager in monitoring

33
01:51.114 --> 01:52.912
that delivery dates are met,

34
01:52.914 --> 01:55.778
assisting the manager in responding to Access to

35
01:55.748 --> 01:59.088
Information requests and ministerial enquiries,

36
01:59.081 --> 02:03.411
and overseeing contract termination.

37
02:03.375 --> 02:05.898
Accessibility should be a consideration

38
02:05.898 --> 02:08.108
throughout the procurement process,

39
02:08.082 --> 02:11.665
not only for employees, but also for contractors.

40
02:11.664 --> 02:14.358
As a manager you may need to engage

41
02:14.341 --> 02:17.248
with contractors about government-created barriers

42
02:17.251 --> 02:19.834
that they are facing when doing the work.

43
02:19.831 --> 02:22.314
Here is a quick exercise to help

44
02:22.314 --> 02:25.108
you determine your responsibilities.

45
02:34.206 --> 02:36.705
Now that you know who is responsible for what,

46
02:36.705 --> 02:38.815
it's paperwork time!

47
02:38.789 --> 02:40.825
Through the contract, you must ensure

48
02:40.829 --> 02:42.515
that records are maintained.

49
02:42.500 --> 02:45.291
You will need to keep information such as quality,

50
02:45.291 --> 02:47.851
quantity and timelines for the goods received

51
02:47.838 --> 02:49.761
or the work to be performed.

52
02:49.750 --> 02:52.933
Any discrepancies in the work of a contractor

53
02:52.929 --> 02:55.228
to whom a contract has been awarded

54
02:55.199 --> 02:56.813
must also be documented.

55
02:56.800 --> 02:59.403
It is important to maintain records

56
02:59.393 --> 03:01.883
so that you can show that what has been purchased

57
03:01.879 --> 03:04.333
has been delivered or that the work

58
03:04.310 --> 03:06.793
has been completed, and you must verify that

59
03:06.776 --> 03:09.075
the goods or services are in accordance

60
03:09.055 --> 03:10.903
with the contract.

61
03:10.875 --> 03:14.708
If you discover inadequate or deficient work, you

62
03:14.708 --> 03:17.578
must advise the procurement specialist immediately

63
03:17.570 --> 03:19.648
so that they can notify the contractor

64
03:19.644 --> 03:23.057
in writing of these deficiencies.

65
03:23.047 --> 03:25.337
The written notification from the procurement

66
03:25.330 --> 03:27.630
specialist will remind the contractor

67
03:27.631 --> 03:30.137
of their obligations under the contract

68
03:30.137 --> 03:32.069
and make them aware of the consequences

69
03:32.061 --> 03:33.919
of failing to correct the deficiency

70
03:33.920 --> 03:36.959
within a specific time period.

71
03:36.956 --> 03:40.339
Good contract monitoring and record keeping

72
03:40.329 --> 03:42.609
leads to good contract management,

73
03:42.604 --> 03:45.271
which helps avoid additional costs and delays,

74
03:45.259 --> 03:49.381
difficulties for contractors and additional work.

75
03:49.371 --> 03:51.321
After all, an ounce of prevention

76
03:51.301 --> 03:54.894
is worth a pound of cure!

77
04:01.789 --> 04:03.443
Before you pay the contract,

78
04:03.433 --> 04:05.093
there are a few things to do.

79
04:05.081 --> 04:07.043
You must first ensure that the terms

80
04:07.043 --> 04:09.083
and conditions of the contract are met.

81
04:09.081 --> 04:11.035
You must check that the goods,

82
04:11.015 --> 04:13.325
services or construction are

83
04:13.314 --> 04:16.425
of the proper quality and in the right quantity,

84
04:16.415 --> 04:19.725
confirm that the goods were received as ordered,

85
04:19.707 --> 04:22.437
confirm that the work was performed,

86
04:22.427 --> 04:23.867
and the services or construction

87
04:23.867 --> 04:26.217
were rendered as per contract,

88
04:26.207 --> 04:29.861
and if the deliverable is a report or other product,

89
04:29.851 --> 04:33.351
ensure that it is complete and free of errors.

90
04:33.332 --> 04:36.676
Then, once you are satisfied with the deliverable,

91
04:36.665 --> 04:39.426
you must ensure that the payment terms are met.

92
04:39.415 --> 04:42.326
Only once this is done can you proceed

93
04:42.317 --> 04:44.617
to paying the contract.

94
04:52.875 --> 04:55.938
As the certification authority under section 34

95
04:55.935 --> 04:58.178
of the Financial Administration Act,

96
04:58.165 --> 05:01.628
your responsibility is to ensure that the work

97
05:01.628 --> 05:03.860
has been performed, that the goods supplied

98
05:03.840 --> 05:06.167
or the service or construction rendered

99
05:06.160 --> 05:08.527
are acceptable, that the deliverables

100
05:08.530 --> 05:11.517
and the invoice are in accordance with the contract.

101
05:11.500 --> 05:15.303
With some types of contracts, this responsibility

102
05:15.273 --> 05:18.143
could be a shared with the procurement specialist.

103
05:18.125 --> 05:21.098
You will verify the accuracy of the invoice

104
05:21.088 --> 05:24.048
or claim by checking the following elements.

105
05:24.040 --> 05:26.073
The invoice date issued is on

106
05:26.045 --> 05:28.345
or after the date the goods or services

107
05:28.314 --> 05:31.333
or construction have been rendered.

108
05:31.332 --> 05:33.366
The line items claimed on the invoice

109
05:33.346 --> 05:35.766
and amount for each item are accurate.

110
05:35.750 --> 05:38.306
They match the order and are within the contract

111
05:38.295 --> 05:41.916
unit price or per diem, and travel limits.

112
05:41.915 --> 05:45.460
The currency, GST and HST,

113
05:45.455 --> 05:50.288
and all applicable taxes and fees are accurate.

114
05:50.250 --> 05:53.303
The supplier or payee information is accurate,

115
05:53.269 --> 05:57.133
and they are eligible for payment.

116
05:57.125 --> 06:00.573
The amount has not previously been paid.

117
06:00.563 --> 06:01.716
Then you will determine

118
06:01.699 --> 06:04.516
how the invoice will be paid.

119
06:04.519 --> 06:06.796
Finally, after reviewing the payment request,

120
06:06.786 --> 06:09.034
the financial officer pays the invoice

121
06:09.014 --> 06:11.126
pursuant to section 33

122
06:11.115 --> 06:13.283
of the Financial Administration Act.

123
06:23.331 --> 06:25.423
Once a contract has been completed,

124
06:25.405 --> 06:27.341
 the procurement specialist responsible

125
06:27.335 --> 06:29.681
for the file will close the file.

126
06:29.665 --> 06:31.798
Before closing the file, a review

127
06:31.786 --> 06:34.468
will be conducted to ensure the following.

128
06:34.457 --> 06:37.251
All contractual requirements have been met

129
06:37.251 --> 06:39.171
and the manager has received

130
06:39.161 --> 06:42.501
and accepted all deliverables under the contract.

131
06:42.500 --> 06:45.033
All payments to the contractor and

132
06:45.033 --> 06:47.553
settlement of claims have been made.

133
06:47.540 --> 06:50.665
No outstanding action is required.

134
06:50.665 --> 06:53.625
All reporting requirements have been met.

135
06:53.625 --> 06:56.625
All required documentation is on file.

136
06:56.625 --> 06:59.684
Amendments to finalization of cost,

137
06:59.684 --> 07:01.844
as required, are complete.

138
07:01.833 --> 07:05.686
Also, if the intellectual property was retained

139
07:05.686 --> 07:07.766
by the Government of Canada,

140
07:07.747 --> 07:10.476
then the appropriate steps need to be taken.

141
07:10.458 --> 07:12.762
If a product has a warranty,

142
07:12.730 --> 07:17.042
the file will remain open for the warranty period.

143
07:17.040 --> 07:20.584
If the file is in audit, it will remain open

144
07:20.582 --> 07:24.614
until the final audit report is filed and accepted.

145
07:24.583 --> 07:27.497
If there is litigation involving the file,

146
07:27.477 --> 07:31.767
it cannot be closed.

147
07:31.750 --> 07:34.604
A review of any lessons learned, including

148
07:34.589 --> 07:36.890
any audit findings, is also done

149
07:36.879 --> 07:39.180
to improve future procurement activities.

150
07:47.458 --> 07:50.040
Take what you have learned into real life!

151
07:50.040 --> 07:51.641
Your organization will have

152
07:51.622 --> 07:53.351
their own ways of doing things.

153
07:53.333 --> 07:55.157
Take time out from the course to see

154
07:55.145 --> 07:56.917
how contracts are administered,

155
07:56.885 --> 07:59.427
paid out and closed in your department.

156
07:59.415 --> 08:01.714
And don't forget to check the Toolbox

157
08:01.697 --> 08:05.470
for a job aid on the procurement process!

158
08:16.125 --> 08:18.118
Now that you have seen how to administer,

159
08:18.075 --> 08:20.838
pay out and close a contract, let's see

160
08:20.835 --> 08:23.684
what you remember by taking this short quiz.

00:08.750 --> 00:12.283
In this section you will learn about the four phases

2
00:12.265 --> 00:14.663
of the life cycle materiel management:

3
00:14.666 --> 00:17.459
planning, acquisition, operation,

4
00:17.451 --> 00:19.999
use and maintenance, and divestiture.

5
00:20.000 --> 00:22.439
This section should take you approximately

6
00:22.434 --> 00:24.736
20 minutes to complete.

7
00:33.395 --> 00:35.696
You have procured the goods that you need.

8
00:35.685 --> 00:37.164
That's great!

9
00:37.164 --> 00:39.019
But did you know that now you need

10
00:39.012 --> 00:41.109
to manage their life cycle?

11
00:41.089 --> 00:42.859
Life cycle materiel management is

12
00:42.847 --> 00:46.053
the effective and efficient management of assets

13
00:46.056 --> 00:48.643
from the identification of requirements

14
00:48.645 --> 00:52.170
to the divestment of the assets.

15
00:52.143 --> 00:54.747
Let's look a little more closely at planning, the first

16
00:54.740 --> 00:57.901
phase of the life cycle materiel management.

17
00:57.867 --> 00:59.867
Since planning was covered in the first three

18
00:59.856 --> 01:02.677
modules of this course, here is a quick summary.

19
01:02.667 --> 01:04.311
During the planning process,

20
01:04.296 --> 01:06.611
managers should determine the following.

21
01:06.611 --> 01:09.223
Is there a clear case to buy or to lease?

22
01:09.206 --> 01:11.061
What are the administration

23
01:11.036 --> 01:12.681
and operational requirements?

24
01:12.667 --> 01:15.959
Is a product or its servicing necessary?

25
01:15.959 --> 01:18.393
What finished goods (materiel)

26
01:18.365 --> 01:21.503
or raw materials are required?

27
01:21.493 --> 01:23.593
Is existing materiel available

28
01:23.581 --> 01:25.944
or appropriate to meet the need?

29
01:25.941 --> 01:29.152
Is it required in the quantity proposed?

30
01:29.152 --> 01:30.954
How was the forecasting done

31
01:30.930 --> 01:33.174
to estimate the requirement?

32
01:33.164 --> 01:35.455
Is capital or operation funding

33
01:35.448 --> 01:38.095
being used to support the acquisition?

34
01:38.081 --> 01:40.515
Which method will be used to acquire

35
01:40.496 --> 01:44.465
the materiel and related support services?

36
01:44.457 --> 01:46.781
Can the requirements be satisfied with

37
01:46.757 --> 01:49.351
 environmentally-friendly products and products

38
01:49.347 --> 01:53.271
that use resource-saving materials or processes?

39
01:53.250 --> 01:55.014
Have other relevant questions,

40
01:54.999 --> 01:57.299
like meeting socio-economic criteria

41
01:57.289 --> 01:59.964
set by the government such as modern treaties,

42
01:59.959 --> 02:02.064
land claims and the promotion of

43
02:02.061 --> 02:04.604
Indigenous business, been considered?

44
02:04.582 --> 02:06.729
Have accessibility considerations

45
02:06.721 --> 02:08.189
been taken into account

46
02:08.180 --> 02:11.889
to identify, remove and prevent new barriers?

47
02:11.875 --> 02:15.359
Materiel acquisition decisions should consider the

48
02:15.346 --> 02:18.679
total cost of the product over the product's life.

49
02:18.667 --> 02:21.021
Once these questions have been answered,

50
02:21.016 --> 02:22.991
you can proceed to the second phase

51
02:22.985 --> 02:25.285
of life cycle materiel management.

52
02:32.750 --> 02:34.845
After the planning phase of the life cycle,

53
02:34.834 --> 02:37.135
it's time for the acquisition phase.

54
02:37.125 --> 02:38.205
This is covered in

55
02:38.189 --> 02:40.505
Modules 4, 5 and 6 of this course.

56
02:40.500 --> 02:44.040
Here managers should acquire the materiel,

57
02:44.040 --> 02:46.859
receive and inspect the goods, and ensure

58
02:46.857 --> 02:51.209
quality assurance and testing is done if applicable.

59
02:51.207 --> 02:54.101
Since the acquisition phase for complex or higher

60
02:54.089 --> 02:56.791
valued items often requires the participation

61
02:56.788 --> 02:59.291
of Public Services and Procurement Canada

62
02:59.290 --> 03:00.964
and the application of additional

63
03:00.944 --> 03:03.204
obligations such as trade agreements,

64
03:03.165 --> 03:05.526
longer timelines are often needed

65
03:05.514 --> 03:07.184
to complete the purchase.

66
03:07.152 --> 03:09.906
So, plan early, and give yourself and everyone

67
03:09.893 --> 03:13.196
involved enough time to acquire what you need!

68
03:19.792 --> 03:22.117
In the operation, use, and maintenance phase

69
03:22.101 --> 03:24.347
of the life cycle materiel management,

70
03:24.332 --> 03:26.357
managers should distribute

71
03:26.344 --> 03:28.187
the materiel so it can be used,

72
03:28.165 --> 03:31.372
maintain records to track inventory holdings and

73
03:31.353 --> 03:35.422
locations, consumption, usage, repairs, costs

74
03:35.422 --> 03:38.192
and ensure that the materiel is properly used,

75
03:38.179 --> 03:40.852
maintained, repaired, and safeguarded.

76
03:40.834 --> 03:43.115
The objective during this phase is to get the

77
03:43.088 --> 03:45.389
most out of the materiel and to make sure it lasts

78
03:45.358 --> 03:49.345
as long as possible based on the best value.

79
03:57.332 --> 03:59.598
In the divestment phase, managers should

80
03:59.584 --> 04:01.885
identify opportunities for replacement,

81
04:01.875 --> 04:05.939
reallocation or disposal of surplus materiel, or of

82
04:05.936 --> 04:09.669
materiel that is no longer cost-effective to operate.

83
04:09.667 --> 04:12.361
Managers should always consider alternatives

84
04:12.329 --> 04:14.401
to disposing of products, such as

85
04:14.399 --> 04:16.700
reallocating or refurbishing them.

86
04:24.959 --> 04:27.250
Take what you have learned into real life!

87
04:27.250 --> 04:29.085
Your organization will have

88
04:29.065 --> 04:30.945
its own ways of doing things.

89
04:30.916 --> 04:32.410
Take a time out from the course

90
04:32.390 --> 04:35.200
to see how the life cycle materiel management

91
04:35.190 --> 04:38.410
process works in your department.

92
04:45.916 --> 04:47.215
So now that you know more about

93
04:47.200 --> 04:49.500
the life cycle materiel management process,

94
04:49.480 --> 04:51.314
 let's see what you remember

95
04:51.310 --> 04:53.610
by taking this short quiz.

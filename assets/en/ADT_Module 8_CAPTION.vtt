00:11.811 --> 00:14.005
In this section you will learn about

2
00:13.995 --> 00:15.825
procurement reporting activities.

3
00:15.814 --> 00:17.975
This will include inappropriate

4
00:17.965 --> 00:19.595
 procurement practices,

5
00:19.585 --> 00:23.390
complaint mechanisms and reporting requirements.

6
00:23.390 --> 00:25.463
This section should take you approximately

7
00:25.459 --> 00:29.273
20 minutes to complete.

8
00:36.435 --> 00:39.072
Before jumping into reporting activities,

9
00:39.072 --> 00:40.969
let’s look at some of the inappropriate

10
00:40.955 --> 00:43.739
procurement practices managers should avoid

11
00:43.739 --> 00:46.339
if they are to remain respectful to the various laws,

12
00:46.311 --> 00:49.988
regulations and policies that apply to procurement.

13
00:49.982 --> 00:53.388
These practices include: contracting without a

14
00:53.379 --> 00:56.188
 written contract or verbal authorization;

15
00:56.189 --> 00:58.957
contracting without proper authority;

16
00:58.957 --> 01:02.668
retroactive or after-the-fact contracting

17
01:02.653 --> 01:05.268
or backdating a contract;

18
01:05.265 --> 01:07.378
contract splitting;

19
01:07.367 --> 01:09.234
payrolling;

20
01:09.234 --> 01:11.947
inappropriate sole-sourcing;

21
01:11.938 --> 01:15.251
employer-employee relationships;

22
01:15.240 --> 01:18.361
inappropriate use of emergency contracting;

23
01:18.343 --> 01:20.531
inappropriate statements of work

24
01:20.520 --> 01:23.334
or evaluation criteria.

25
01:23.316 --> 01:25.004
The following exercise will help

26
01:24.985 --> 01:27.224
you determine what not to do.

27
01:27.219 --> 01:29.814
For definitions, see the What Not To Do

28
01:29.795 --> 01:33.729
job aid in the tool box.

29
01:43.236 --> 01:45.660
So, you have seen what you can and cannot do

30
01:45.652 --> 01:47.842
in terms of your decisions and actions

31
01:47.832 --> 01:49.482
 in the procurement process,

32
01:49.475 --> 01:51.819
but what if you don’t abide by these rules?

33
01:51.806 --> 01:54.179
What are the repercussions?

34
01:54.147 --> 01:55.929
There are different levels of authorities

35
01:55.910 --> 01:58.169
that provide oversight of federal public

36
01:58.150 --> 01:59.769
service procurement to ensure

37
01:59.770 --> 02:01.612
the rules are being followed.

38
02:01.587 --> 02:03.352
Authorities can be internal

39
02:03.324 --> 02:05.232
or external to organizations.

40
02:05.224 --> 02:07.912
For example, many departments may have ethics

41
02:07.883 --> 02:10.832
advisers or compliance and oversight branches,

42
02:10.832 --> 02:14.246
and interdepartmental governance committees.

43
02:14.224 --> 02:16.576
These authorities may provide support

44
02:16.574 --> 02:18.416
 to resolve issues internally

45
02:18.413 --> 02:22.056
before formal escalation is required.

46
02:22.040 --> 02:24.740
Authorities with oversight responsibilities for

47
02:24.715 --> 02:27.560
procurement in the federal public service include:

48
02:27.546 --> 02:30.150
the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman,

49
02:30.150 --> 02:32.910
the Canadian International Trade Tribunal,

50
02:32.885 --> 02:34.753
the Federal Court,

51
02:34.753 --> 02:37.552
Internal Audit in departments or delivered centrally

52
02:37.542 --> 02:40.192
through the Office of the Comptroller General,

53
02:40.193 --> 02:42.162
the Auditor General,

54
02:42.152 --> 02:44.902
and Standing Review Committees.

55
02:44.864 --> 02:47.770
Their roles differ depending on the nature

56
02:47.761 --> 02:50.530
and monetary amount of the procurement.

57
02:50.502 --> 02:52.890
Curious to know more about these organizations?

58
02:52.880 --> 02:54.590
Why not consult the Oversight

59
02:54.569 --> 02:57.994
job aid in the tool box?

60
03:06.085 --> 03:08.193
Did you know that departments, agencies,

61
03:08.186 --> 03:10.563
 and other organizations are responsible

62
03:10.556 --> 03:12.583
for making available various reports

63
03:12.570 --> 03:14.523
on contracting activities

64
03:14.523 --> 03:17.724
for the general public or for use within government?

65
03:17.697 --> 03:20.804
That’s why record keeping is so important and why

66
03:20.809 --> 03:24.529
the data reported on contracts must be accurate.

67
03:24.503 --> 03:26.454
Here is a list of reports for which

68
03:26.445 --> 03:28.745
you may have to provide input.

69
03:28.738 --> 03:31.031
Proactive Disclosure of Contracts

70
03:31.009 --> 03:33.761
Contracts with Former Public Servants

71
03:33.746 --> 03:36.691
Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements

72
03:36.682 --> 03:40.051
Procurement Strategy for Aboriginal Business

73
03:40.052 --> 03:42.721
Treasury Board Directive on Government Contracts,

74
03:42.721 --> 03:44.371
Including Real Property Lease,

75
03:44.351 --> 03:47.421
in the Nunavut Settlement Area

76
03:47.406 --> 03:49.871
Ownership of Intellectual Property

77
03:49.861 --> 03:52.655
Auditor General Reports

78
03:52.632 --> 03:54.835
Internal Audit Reports

79
03:54.834 --> 03:58.455
Access to Information and Privacy

80
03:58.437 --> 04:02.182
But contract information is not only used in reports.

81
04:02.175 --> 04:04.644
It is also used for proactive disclosure,

82
04:04.644 --> 04:07.675
which is posted on the Open Government Portal

83
04:07.646 --> 04:10.302
as required to meet legal, policy,

84
04:10.287 --> 04:13.462
corporate, and parliamentary needs.

85
04:13.453 --> 04:16.287
For example, your contract awards and amendments

86
04:16.286 --> 04:18.257
are made available to the public,

87
04:18.223 --> 04:21.027
due to the proactive disclosure of contracts,

88
04:21.023 --> 04:24.897
when their value is more than $10,000.

89
04:24.863 --> 04:27.533
They are published on the Open Government Portal,

90
04:27.533 --> 04:30.298
thus making government and public service officials

91
04:30.301 --> 04:33.068
accountable to Canadians.

92
04:33.072 --> 04:35.556
This reporting is normally done by the procurement

93
04:35.539 --> 04:38.506
specialist or contracting officer.

94
04:38.478 --> 04:41.766
Though it may not be your responsibility, it is

95
04:41.755 --> 04:45.016
important that you are aware of these requirements.

96
04:44.983 --> 04:47.551
But don’t worry, you won’t be doing this reporting

97
04:47.541 --> 04:49.361
or proactive disclosure alone!

98
04:49.322 --> 04:51.923
Usually, you will work with your administrative staff

99
04:51.923 --> 04:54.591
or your organization’s procurement team

100
04:54.591 --> 04:57.394
to prepare the information needed.

101
05:06.204 --> 05:08.696
Take what you have learned into real life!

102
05:08.675 --> 05:10.116
Your organization will have

103
05:10.104 --> 05:12.056
its own ways of doing things.

104
05:12.011 --> 05:13.806
Take time out from the course to see

105
05:13.813 --> 05:16.036
which complaint mechanisms

106
05:16.014 --> 05:18.638
are used by your organization as well as

107
05:18.638 --> 05:23.168
which reports will need to be supported.

108
05:33.966 --> 05:35.303
So now that you know more

109
05:35.307 --> 05:37.943
about inappropriate procurement practices,

110
05:37.937 --> 05:40.944
complaint mechanisms and reporting,

111
05:40.939 --> 05:42.440
let’s see what you remember

112
05:42.424 --> 05:45.884
by taking this short quiz.

4
00:15.140 --> 00:18.840
identify goods, services, and construction needs,

5
00:18.840 --> 00:20.880
and verify if goods, services,

6
00:20.880 --> 00:24.490
and construction already exist within government.

7
00:24.490 --> 00:27.480

8
00:27.480 --> 00:28.533
to complete.

9
00:31.080 --> 00:34.163
(gentle piano music)

10
00:35.400 --> 00:37.450
To find out which goods, services

11
00:37.450 --> 00:39.210
and construction you may need,

12
00:39.210 --> 00:41.690
start by reviewing your work plan.

13
00:41.690 --> 00:44.810
Look at your activities and sub activities.

14
00:44.810 --> 00:48.030
Do you have the resources needed to deliver them?

15
00:48.030 --> 00:49.680
If you do, that's great.

16
00:49.680 --> 00:53.710
If you do not, which goods or services are missing?

17
00:53.710 --> 00:55.570
Looking at the work plan provided,

18
00:55.570 --> 00:59.530
identify which goods and services you will need to procure

19
00:59.530 --> 01:01.883
by answering the following questions.

20
01:04.731 --> 01:07.814
(gentle piano music)

21
01:10.610 --> 01:12.560
Now that you've looked at your work plan

22
01:12.560 --> 01:14.730
and identified all the goods and services

23
01:14.730 --> 01:17.690
that you will need to carry out your activities,

24
01:17.690 --> 01:20.410
check to see if they already exist.

25
01:20.410 --> 01:23.520
Ask yourself the following questions.

26
01:23.520 --> 01:25.310
Is there an available stockpile

27
01:25.310 --> 01:27.103
or inventory in the department?

28
01:28.610 --> 01:30.633
Are existing ones accessible?

29
01:31.660 --> 01:33.630
Can the goods or services be transferred

30
01:33.630 --> 01:35.840
from one unit to another?

31
01:35.840 --> 01:39.073
Are there other similar goods or services that can be used?

32
01:41.830 --> 01:45.120
Before initiating any procurement processes,

33
01:45.120 --> 01:48.400
always check to see if the goods and services you require

34
01:48.400 --> 01:50.900
are already at your disposal.

35
01:50.900 --> 01:54.543
Often, the resources you need are right at your fingertips!

36
01:56.747 --> 01:59.830
(gentle piano music)

37
02:01.090 --> 02:03.850
Take what you've learned into real life.

38
02:03.850 --> 02:07.550
Your organization will have its own ways of doing things.

39
02:07.550 --> 02:09.920
Take a time out from the course to see how goods

40
02:09.920 --> 02:13.870
and services needs are identified in your department.

41
02:13.870 --> 02:16.120
You may find that you already have access

42
02:16.120 --> 02:18.440
to certain resources through various teams

43
02:18.440 --> 02:21.650
such as Security, Shared Travel Services,

44
02:21.650 --> 02:25.000
Accommodations, Shared Services Canada,

45
02:25.000 --> 02:28.470
Training and Accessibility and Duty to Accommodate,

46
02:28.470 --> 02:29.567
to name but a few.

47
02:31.899 --> 02:34.982
(gentle piano music)

48
02:36.920 --> 02:39.343
Now that you know how to analyze a work plan,

49
02:40.640 --> 02:43.883
how to identify goods, services and construction needs,

50
02:44.930 --> 02:47.640
and how to compare goods and services needed

51
02:47.640 --> 02:50.293
with existing goods and services on hand,

52
02:51.340 --> 02:54.723
let's see what you remember by taking this short quiz.

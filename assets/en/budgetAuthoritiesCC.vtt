00:00.248 --> 00:02.748
(light music)

2
00:11.170 --> 00:12.320
- [Narrator] In this section

3
00:12.320 --> 00:14.960
you will learn to verify your budget,

4
00:14.960 --> 00:18.310
distinguish between spending and financial authorities

5
00:18.310 --> 00:20.180
and procurement authorities,

6
00:20.180 --> 00:22.480
and confirm who has approval authority

7
00:22.480 --> 00:24.710
through financial delegation charts.

8
00:24.710 --> 00:25.820
This section should take you

9
00:25.820 --> 00:28.323
approximately 20 minutes to complete.

10
00:30.580 --> 00:33.080
(light music)

11
00:34.790 --> 00:37.230
Before beginning your procurement process,

12
00:37.230 --> 00:38.063
you must check

13
00:38.063 --> 00:39.730
that there are sufficient funds in your budget

14
00:39.730 --> 00:41.860
to cover the costs of the goods,

15
00:41.860 --> 00:45.490
the services, and the construction that you are planning.

16
00:45.490 --> 00:46.610
If you don't have enough funds,

17
00:46.610 --> 00:49.960
you may have to turn to other sources to find the money,

18
00:49.960 --> 00:53.900
such as transfer funds within your own budgets,

19
00:53.900 --> 00:56.590
get extra money from other managers,

20
00:56.590 --> 01:00.270
use an untapped surplus your director might have,

21
01:00.270 --> 01:01.980
prepare a Treasury Board submission

22
01:01.980 --> 01:04.450
or a Memorandum to Cabinet,

23
01:04.450 --> 01:06.030
and, depending on your business,

24
01:06.030 --> 01:09.940
tap into an interdepartmental settlement.

25
01:09.940 --> 01:12.160
The following exercise will help you determine

26
01:12.160 --> 01:14.263
if you have enough funds in your budget.

27
01:17.234 --> 01:19.734
(light music)

28
01:22.120 --> 01:25.010
Now that you know if you have enough money in your budget,

29
01:25.010 --> 01:27.280
let's check to see if you have the proper authority

30
01:27.280 --> 01:30.810
to begin buying the resources that you need.

31
01:30.810 --> 01:33.850
Did you know that Parliament created two authority streams?

32
01:33.850 --> 01:35.940
It created one for financial authorities

33
01:35.940 --> 01:38.690
and another for procurement authorities.

34
01:38.690 --> 01:40.790
To exercise your financial authority,

35
01:40.790 --> 01:43.760
you need to successfully complete this course,

36
01:43.760 --> 01:47.210
submit your signed delegation card to your finance unit,

37
01:47.210 --> 01:51.090
and receive your formal delegation of authority in writing

38
01:51.090 --> 01:52.773
from your finance unit.

39
01:54.250 --> 01:57.740
Managers typically have two delegated authorities:

40
01:57.740 --> 02:00.920
Section 32 for commitment authority

41
02:00.920 --> 02:05.260
and Section 34 for certification authority.

42
02:05.260 --> 02:08.900
Section 32 would allow you to order office supplies,

43
02:08.900 --> 02:11.930
while Section 34 would allow you to sign off

44
02:11.930 --> 02:14.570
on having received the supplies.

45
02:14.570 --> 02:17.160
For more information on Sections 32 and 34,

46
02:17.160 --> 02:19.060
see the toolbox.

47
02:19.060 --> 02:22.110
Then, Section 33 allows the finance unit

48
02:22.110 --> 02:24.140
to pay for the supplies.

49
02:24.140 --> 02:25.610
In certain situations,

50
02:25.610 --> 02:28.300
for example, temporary help services,

51
02:28.300 --> 02:30.460
you will need to go through a procurement process

52
02:30.460 --> 02:33.390
because it involves a contract.

53
02:33.390 --> 02:36.210
These situations are governed by Section 41

54
02:36.210 --> 02:38.890
of the Financial Administration Act

55
02:38.890 --> 02:40.570
and would typically be managed

56
02:40.570 --> 02:43.893
by the procurement section in your organization.

57
02:45.440 --> 02:47.360
As for procurement authorities,

58
02:47.360 --> 02:49.710
they are divided into two streams,

59
02:49.710 --> 02:53.080
one for goods and the other for services.

60
02:53.080 --> 02:55.000
Under the Department of Public Works

61
02:55.000 --> 02:56.850
and Government Services Act,

62
02:56.850 --> 03:00.340
the Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada,

63
03:00.340 --> 03:05.100
PSPC, has the exclusive authority to acquire goods.

64
03:05.100 --> 03:06.630
The Minister of PSPC

65
03:06.630 --> 03:09.180
then delegates this authority to ministers

66
03:09.180 --> 03:12.110
to make purchases for their respective organizations

67
03:12.110 --> 03:14.930
according to specific contract values.

68
03:14.930 --> 03:18.060
Through their organizational delegation instruments,

69
03:18.060 --> 03:21.660
contracting authority is then delegated to positions

70
03:21.660 --> 03:24.343
once certain conditions have been met.

71
03:26.410 --> 03:27.890
Parliament grants authority

72
03:27.890 --> 03:29.960
for procurement services to ministers

73
03:29.960 --> 03:33.670
through their organization's enabling legislation.

74
03:33.670 --> 03:36.080
Treasury Board limits ministerial authorities

75
03:36.080 --> 03:39.380
through policies like its Contracting Policy

76
03:39.380 --> 03:41.713
and Common Services Policy.

77
03:42.650 --> 03:44.590
Contracting authority for services

78
03:44.590 --> 03:46.850
can also be delegated to positions

79
03:46.850 --> 03:49.770
through the organizational delegation instrument

80
03:49.770 --> 03:51.080
and can be exercised

81
03:51.080 --> 03:53.860
once certain conditions have been met.

82
03:53.860 --> 03:56.180
To know what and how much you can authorize,

83
03:56.180 --> 03:58.640
consult your own signed delegation card

84
03:58.640 --> 04:01.840
and your organization's delegation chart.

85
04:01.840 --> 04:04.590
Again, the format of these documents will differ

86
04:04.590 --> 04:06.253
depending on where you work.

87
04:09.343 --> 04:10.920
(light music)

88
04:10.920 --> 04:13.660
Take what you've learned into real life.

89
04:13.660 --> 04:17.220
Your organization will have its own ways of doing things.

90
04:17.220 --> 04:20.250
Take a time out from the course to consult your budgets

91
04:20.250 --> 04:23.733
and your organization's financial signing authority chart.

92
04:24.840 --> 04:28.400
What are your department's procurement spending limits?

93
04:28.400 --> 04:29.490
Do you need to consult

94
04:29.490 --> 04:32.580
Public Services and Procurement Canada?

95
04:32.580 --> 04:35.270
Does your department have its own set of procurement rules,

96
04:35.270 --> 04:37.690
such as the Department of National Defense

97
04:37.690 --> 04:39.603
or the Department of Justice?

98
04:42.052 --> 04:44.552
(light music)

99
04:47.480 --> 04:49.940
Now that you know how to verify your budget,

100
04:49.940 --> 04:53.150
distinguish between financial and procurement authorities,

101
04:53.150 --> 04:55.820
and consult your financial delegation charts,

102
04:55.820 --> 04:59.313
let's see what you remember by taking this short quiz.

103
04:59.313 --> 05:01.813

00:11.130 --> 00:12.310
- [Presenter] In this section,

3
00:12.310 --> 00:15.290
you will learn to determine the types of costs, for goods

4
00:15.290 --> 00:19.160
and services, to include in the procurement estimates,

5
00:19.160 --> 00:21.300
and to conduct a risk assessment

6
00:21.300 --> 00:23.750
and to draft a mitigation strategy

7
00:23.750 --> 00:27.540
in case the goods or services are not acquired.

8
00:27.540 --> 00:28.720
This section should take you

9
00:28.720 --> 00:31.383
approximately 30 minutes to complete.

10
00:34.285 --> 00:37.452
(contemplative music)

11
00:38.880 --> 00:41.640
Before any purchase, start by estimating

12
00:41.640 --> 00:45.660
how much your goods, services or construction will cost.

13
00:45.660 --> 00:47.090
This could be done in many ways,

14
00:47.090 --> 00:50.620
including looking at previous purchases,

15
00:50.620 --> 00:54.930
consulting purchasing catalogs or supplier websites,

16
00:54.930 --> 00:58.810
doing an internet search, gathering information

17
00:58.810 --> 01:03.230
from a supplier, looking at rental options,

18
01:03.230 --> 01:06.510
or asking for an expert advice from Public Services

19
01:06.510 --> 01:08.013
and Procurement Canada.

20
01:10.190 --> 01:12.760
Don't forget to find out if there are any other costs

21
01:12.760 --> 01:15.900
related to your purchase, such as delivery costs,

22
01:15.900 --> 01:20.900
life cycle costs, sustainment costs and disposal costs.

23
01:21.150 --> 01:23.200
All should be included in your estimate.

24
01:23.200 --> 01:25.370
After all, you wouldn't wanna get a car

25
01:25.370 --> 01:28.703
if you can't afford the auto insurance, gas and maintenance!

26
01:31.196 --> 01:34.363
(contemplative music)

27
01:37.236 --> 01:39.790
Ever wonder what would happen if you were unable

28
01:39.790 --> 01:41.883
to procure the resources that you needed?

29
01:42.730 --> 01:44.790
When procurement is not an option,

30
01:44.790 --> 01:46.460
you will need to find other ways

31
01:46.460 --> 01:48.800
to accomplish your activities.

32
01:48.800 --> 01:51.830
Hints on how you can do this are actually found

33
01:51.830 --> 01:55.133
in the risk and mitigation sections of your work plan.

34
01:58.010 --> 02:00.030
To conduct a risk assessment

35
02:00.030 --> 02:02.640
and draft a mitigation strategy,

36
02:02.640 --> 02:05.680
you identify any events that could stop you

37
02:05.680 --> 02:07.940
from delivering your activities,

38
02:07.940 --> 02:11.190
determine the probability as to whether the event

39
02:11.190 --> 02:15.860
will happen or not, identify any potential losses

40
02:15.860 --> 02:18.760
or impacts associated with the event

41
02:18.760 --> 02:21.600
and identify any actions you can take

42
02:21.600 --> 02:24.753
to lower the potential of that event happening.

43
02:25.740 --> 02:29.000
The following exercise will help you identify the risks

44
02:29.000 --> 02:31.363
associated with your activities.

45
02:35.203 --> 02:37.350
(contemplative music)

46
02:37.350 --> 02:40.650
Take what you've learned into real life.

47
02:40.650 --> 02:44.120
Your organization will have its own ways of doing things.

48
02:44.120 --> 02:45.680
Take a time out from the course

49
02:45.680 --> 02:49.153
to see how budgets are forecasted in your department.

50
02:50.200 --> 02:52.060
Connect with your colleagues, director

51
02:52.060 --> 02:54.240
or financial management advisor,

52
02:54.240 --> 02:57.010
and chat about existing financial resources

53
02:57.010 --> 02:58.633
for your procurement needs.

54
03:00.021 --> 03:03.188
(contemplative music)

55
03:05.730 --> 03:09.100
Now that you know how to determine the types of costs

56
03:09.100 --> 03:11.670
to include in the procurement estimates,

57
03:11.670 --> 03:14.260
how to conduct a risk assessment

58
03:14.260 --> 03:16.713
and how to draft a mitigation strategy,

59
03:17.860 --> 03:20.783
let's see what you remember by taking this short quiz.

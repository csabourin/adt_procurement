00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:05.333
Welcome!

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.417
You’re in the right place if you’re a manager

00:00:07.417 --> 00:00:09.208
looking to learn about how to make

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:15.125
responsible use of public funds—for planning, spending and reporting.

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:17.500
There are many reasons why managers like you

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.667
might take this course.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:23.125
You might be a new manager, who’s new at financial delegation

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:25.583
and you need to learn everything there is to know

00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:27.792
about your financial responsibilities.

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.208
You could be an experienced manager,

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:33.667
but new to government and looking to leverage your experience

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:36.709
by connecting what you already know about finance

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:38.667
to the realm of government.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:41.333
Maybe you just came back from a parental leave

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.291
and you could really use a refresher

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:45.375
on your financial responsibilities

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:48.000
and what might have changed since you left.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.417
Or perhaps you’re an experienced manager in government

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:54.208
and you need to recertify every 5 years

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:57.750
in order to continue exercising your financial delegation.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.250
Maybe you just really want to get to the test!

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.000
Whatever brought you here, you’re in charge of your own learning.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.875
Think of this as a “choose your own adventure” kind of experience

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:10.667
and take what you need in order to succeed.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:12.792
If all you need is to take the test

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:15.458
because you’re already pretty familiar with the content,

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:17.959
then, by all means, start with that.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.875
If you just need an overview or a refresher,

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:24.166
then simply review the key messages of each phase

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.959
to get to the key highlights and tools.

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:31.333
You'll also want to make use of the handy features on your screen,

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.166
like the toolbox on the top right,

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:36.625
which has tools and resources to help you on the job.

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:40.291
If you’re learning this for the first time, then take the time to go

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.917
through each section,

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:43.959
do the in-depth learning activities,

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.125
and review the tools and resources.

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:48.291
We promise it’s worth the effort!

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:51.583
You’re probably wondering about the test.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:54.709
Passing the test for this course is mandatory

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.000
before you can exercise financial delegation.

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:02.458
There are three sections to the test—one for each phase:

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:05.250
planning, spending and reporting.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.792
The passing grade is 80% for each of the sections.

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:13.041
Each section should take you around 15 – 20 minutes to complete.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:16.250
You can access course materials during the test

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.959
and you can take it as many times as you need.

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.083
In the end, how you use this course is really up to you!

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.792
 It will remain accessible to you so you can come back to

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:30.542
consult different sections and tools whenever you need on the job!

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:32.792
We’re rooting for you!

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:35.458
Because when you steward public funds well,

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:37.417
you succeed in your career.

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:39.041
And, more importantly,

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:40.583
you serve Canadians well,

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:43.291
with transparency and accountability.

00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:45.083
And that’s the bottom line.

            <p>Efficient method of supply that allows suppliers to be pre-qualified with a standardized or pre-defined offering, and pre-established terms and conditions.</p>
            <p>Allows greater speed when ordering goods and services because bulk of negotiation and procurement process has been completed before transactions are required.</p>
            <p>Volume purchases government-wide can reduce prices and increase standardization.</p>
            <p>Not as suitable for volatile priced commodities.</p>
            <p>Impacts of fluctuations in exchange rates can affect prices.</p>
            <p>Call-Ups against a Standing Offer provide easy access to goods and services with faster turnaround.</p>
            <p>Each standing offer contains call-up procedures (instructions) and sets a dollar limit on the value of individual call-ups.</p>

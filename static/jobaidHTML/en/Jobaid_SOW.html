      <p> Used when the requirement can be clearly defined but the
        expected quantities or level of effort and timing are unknown. </p>
      <p> Used when Canada is unable to offer a minimum work guarantee
        to the supplier or when there are multiple suppliers who can
        provide the product or service. </p>
      <p> The use of Public Services and Procurement Canada Standing
        Offers is mandatory for the ten commodity groups identified in
        Schedule 4, Part 1, of the Treasury Board Contracts Directive. </p>
      <p> The Call-Up (Form 942) Against A Standing Offer Instrument is
        used to order against the Standing Offer method of supply when
        the amount of the commonly required goods or services is known. </p>
      <p> The use of PSPC Standing Offers is mandatory for the commodity
        groups identified in Appendix C – Treasury Board Contracts
        Directive, Part 1, Schedule 4. The Call-Up along with the terms
        and conditions specified in the Standing Offer form the Contract. </p>

      <p> Efficient method of supply that allows suppliers to be prequalified
        with a standardized/pre-defined offering, and preestablished
        terms and conditions. </p>
      <p> Allows greater speed when ordering goods and services because
        bulk of negotiation and procurement process has been completed
        before transactions are required. </p>
      <p> Volume purchases government-wide can reduce prices and
        increase standardization. </p>
      <p> Not as suitable for volatile commodities. </p>
      <p> Impacts of fluctuations in exchange rates can affect prices. </p>
      <p> Call-Ups against a Standing Offer provide easy access to goods
        and services with faster turnaround. </p>
      <p> Each standing offer contains call-up procedures (instructions)
        and sets a dollar limit on the value of individual call-ups. </p>

        Contracts are established when they are issued against existing
        Supply Arrangements. </p>

        and Procurement Canada that create a pool of pre-qualified
        bidders with pre-established parameters. </p>

      <p> Can be used as a procurement instrument and/or a method of
        payment (i.e. Form 942 Call-Up is optional). </p>

      <p> Efficient, secure, and simple to use. </p>
      <p> Reduced processing costs because of less administration and

        facilitated. </p>
      <p> Leverage volume discounts for lower prices or rebates from
        government-wide purchases. </p>

      <p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
      <p> Service-level Agreements or Interdepartmental Agreements are used between federal departments/agencies. They are not considered
        procurement instruments because new goods and services are not being procured, rather there is an interdepartmental settlement or
        re-appropriation of funds between departments/agencies that results. </p>

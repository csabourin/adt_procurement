            <h3><i>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</i></h3>
        </div>
        <p>The <i>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</i> grants the mandate to provide goods and materiel and other services to organizations to support and assist them in meeting their obligations. This includes planning for and the acquisition of supplies and services, and the provision of office accommodation and other facilities. 
        The Act gives the Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) the exclusive authority for the acquisition of goods. All ministers have the inherent power to contract; however, the authority given to the minister in section 9 of this Act supplants the authority of each organization to contract for goods. This authority may be restored to the extent determined by the minister through a delegation, in accordance with section 8 of this Act. 
        Typically, this authority is delegated for goods up to $100,000 for sole-source contracts and $750,000 for competitive contracts or as per a limit set out in a PSPC standing offer or for goods bought during an emergency.</p>

        <h3>Trade Agreements</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Many trade agreements have a role in developing Canada’s trade network. The two most important are:</p>
    <ol style="padding-left: 30px">
        <li><i>World Trade Organization</i> – <i>Agreement on Government Procurement</i> (WTO – AGP)</li>
        <li><i>Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)</i></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Depending on the nature, scope and estimated dollar value of the procurement, one or more trade agreements may apply. Applicable trade agreements could have an impact on the bid solicitation period and the bid solicitation approach. Consult a procurement specialist about contracts with an estimated value of greater than $25,000 to determine the rules that apply.</p>

            <p>Modern treaties/Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs) have been negotiated to ensure the fair treatment of Indigenous interests with respect to cultural, social, political and economic rights, including rights to lands and to fish and hunt and practise their culture. Although some modern treaties/CLCAs include measures dealing with procurement, these measures are not identical in all the various agreements. However, they are all aimed at enhancing the economic opportunities of the Indigenous group benefiting from the agreement, usually through increased possibilities of competing successfully for contracts in their settlement areas or of participating in employment, training or subcontracting opportunities.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Where there is a final delivery of a good or service, including construction, to a land claim area or an area requiring access to modern treaty/CLCA land, a contracting authority must be consulted to help determine which modern treaty/CLCA obligations apply and how to satisfy them. This is because each modern treaty/CLCA has different requirements for government procurement, depending on the agreement.</p>

        <h3>Indigenous Business</h3>
    </div>
    <p>The Procurement Strategy for Aboriginal Business (PSAB) consists of measures intended to increase the number of Indigenous firms competing for and winning federal contracts. One of the primary components of the PSAB is “set-asides,” where procurements are taken out of the normal context and reserved for Indigenous businesses. Mandatory set-asides are for procurements over $5,000 for which Indigenous populations are the primary recipients; voluntary set-asides are other procurements voluntarily set aside by organizations.</p>
    <p>Your organization sets annual targets for contracts with Indigenous businesses that may impact your procurement. Your procurement specialist will inform you of the process for PSAB set-asides.</p>

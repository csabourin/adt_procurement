                        <p>Used when Canada is unable to offer a minimum work guarantee to the supplier or when there are multiple suppliers who can provide the product or service.</p>
                <p>Standing Offers must address the obligations under the Comprehensive Land Claims Areas in order to be used in a settlement area.</p>
                <p>The Call-Up (Form 942) Against A Standing Offer Instrument is used to order against the Standing Offer method of supply when the amount of the commonly required goods or services is known.</p>
                <p>The use of PSPC Standing Offers is mandatory for the commodity groups identified in Appendix C – Treasury Board Contracts Directive, Part 1, Schedule 4. The Call-Up along with the terms and conditions specified in the Standing Offer form the Contract.</p>

            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>Efficient method of supply that allows suppliers to be pre-qualified with a standardized or pre-defined offering, and pre-established terms and conditions.</p>
            <p>Allows greater speed when ordering goods and services because bulk of negotiation and procurement process has been completed before transactions are required.</p>
            <p>Volume purchases government-wide can reduce prices and increase standardization.</p>
            <p>Not as suitable for volatile priced commodities.</p>
            <p>Impacts of fluctuations in exchange rates can affect prices.</p>
            <p>Call-Ups against a Standing Offer provide easy access to goods and services with faster turnaround.</p>
            <p>Each standing offer contains call-up procedures (instructions) and sets a dollar limit on the value of individual call-ups.</p>

            <p>Departments and Agencies can take advantage of the numerous Supply Arrangements for services put in place by PSPC that create a pool of prequalified bidders with pre-established parameters. Ceiling prices are established but are competed within pre-qualified suppliers.</p>
            <p>The requirement can be competed amongst the pre-screened bidders, reducing process times.</p>

            <p>Service-level Agreements or Interdepartmental Agreements are used between federal Departments or agencies.
